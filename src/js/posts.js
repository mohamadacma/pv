    content: `I've visited New Orleans for four days and I think that was a mistake. New Orleans is definitely a 2-day city. By the end of the second day, the ennui begins to strike and you start feeling the passage of time, like "am I in a Nuri Ceylan movie or something?"

That said, I've had some really cool learning experiences at a couple of places that I found super interesting. My Uber driver was born and raised in NOLA, and I basically barraged him with questions about the city for the entire trip. He told me about how New Orleans was never colonized by the British - only by the French and Spanish. He was right about that - the French founded it in 1718, then it was under Spanish control from 1763 to 1802, went briefly back to France, and then was sold to the United States in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase.

The driver also mentioned something fascinating about the tombstones being above ground because of floods, taking after the French model. This is actually true - New Orleans' high water table and tendency to flood meant that buried coffins would sometimes float back up during heavy rains. The above-ground tombs, often called "cities of the dead," became a practical solution that also ended up creating these beautiful and iconic cemeteries.

Now, The World War II Museum might just be one of the most educational history lessons I've ever had. I never thought of museums as a medium to learn about history before. I guess this time around I took my time to read through everything chronologically and really experience the various events. You can read history books about the events that led to World War II and the immense role of the US, but can you get the same educational depth you get from a 4-hour museum tour? Definitely not.

One of the other museums that I really enjoyed was the Pharmacy Museum. I learned about chemicals used as medicine way before the invention of antibiotics and penicillin and all that jazz. It's simply unthinkable to want to live at that time and experience the horror of getting down with syphilis, for example, and having to surgically have your middle finger attached to your nose so that a new nose grows back (yes, this was a real procedure called a rhinoplasty using a forehead or arm flap, developed in the 1800s - wild stuff).

I did a lot of walking - it really looked like an aged city. While I was walking around Bourbon Street and Frenchmen Street, I walked into a random jazz club where a show was about to begin. Got a ticket and it turned into an excellent 2-hour event with a funny and talented jazz orchestra.

So yeah, my advice? Plan for two days, maybe three if you're really into museums. Beyond that, you might find yourself checking your watch a bit too often.`,
